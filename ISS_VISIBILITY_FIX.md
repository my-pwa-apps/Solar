# ISS Visibility Fix - October 9, 2025

## Issue
ISS was not visible after adding all 17 modules and detailed structures.

## Root Cause
The scale factor was set to `0.00005` which made the ISS extremely small - realistic but invisible at normal viewing distances.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Increased Scale Factor
**Changed:** `const scale = 0.00005;`  
**To:** `const scale = 0.0003;`  
**Reason:** 6x larger makes the ISS visible while maintaining relative proportions

### 2. Enhanced Visibility Markers

**Glow Sphere:**
- **Old:** `scale * 2` radius, `opacity: 0.3`
- **New:** `scale * 10` radius, `opacity: 0.5`
- **Result:** 5x larger, more visible glow

**Center Marker:**
- **Old:** `scale * 0.5` radius, basic material
- **New:** `scale * 3` radius with emissive glow
- **Result:** 6x larger with gold glow for easier spotting

### 3. Added Debug Logging
- Console logs mesh count on ISS creation
- Logs ISS position, visibility, and child count during orbit
- Helps verify ISS is being created and animated correctly

## Expected Results
✅ ISS now visible when near Earth orbit  
✅ Maintains all 17 modules and detailed structures  
✅ Gold marker easily visible from distance  
✅ White glow helps locate ISS  
✅ Scale still proportional to keep educational accuracy  

## How to View ISS
1. Start the application
2. Look for Earth in the solar system
3. Zoom toward Earth
4. Look for gold marker orbiting Earth at ~1.05 Earth radii
5. Click "ISS (International Space Station)" in Explorer panel to focus on it

## Technical Details
- **Orbit altitude:** 408-410 km (1.05 Earth radii in scene)
- **Orbit speed:** 7.66 km/s (15.5 orbits/day)
- **Real dimensions:** 109m × 73m × 20m
- **Scene scale:** 0.0003 (0.03% of Earth radius)
- **Components:** 50+ mesh objects (modules, arrays, radiators, arms)
