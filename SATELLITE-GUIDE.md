# 🛰️ Quick Guide: Finding the Satellites

## Where to Look

### In the 3D View:
1. Load the application (open `index.html`)
2. Make sure "Solar System" topic is selected
3. **Look for Earth** (the blue planet with atmosphere)
4. **Small metallic objects orbit around Earth** - these are the satellites!

### Visual Identification:
- **Gray box with solar panels** = ISS
- **Blue spacecraft with panels** = Hubble
- **Green satellite with antenna** = GPS
- **Golden spacecraft (far away)** = James Webb
- **Small red/pink object** = Starlink

## How to Interact

### Method 1: Click in 3D View
1. Click directly on any satellite in the 3D scene
2. Camera will focus and follow it
3. Information panel appears on the left

### Method 2: Use Space Explorer Panel
1. Click "Space Explorer" button (right side panel)
2. Scroll down to **"Satellites"** section
3. You'll see 5 entries:
   ```
   🛰️ ISS (International Space Station)
   🛰️ Hubble Space Telescope
   🛰️ GPS Satellites
   🛰️ James Webb Space Telescope
   🛰️ Starlink Constellation
   ```
4. Click any name to focus on it

## Inspection Controls

Once focused on a satellite:
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Left Click + Drag**: Rotate around satellite
- **Right Click + Drag**: Pan camera
- **Watch it orbit**: The satellite will orbit Earth while you watch!

## Special Notes

### ISS & Hubble (Close to Earth)
- Orbit very close to Earth (visible as tiny objects)
- Complete one orbit every 90-95 minutes (sped up in simulation)
- Zoom in VERY CLOSE to see solar panel details

### GPS Satellites (Medium Distance)
- Orbit further out than ISS/Hubble
- Take 12 hours to complete orbit
- Green color makes them easy to spot

### James Webb (Very Far)
- Orbits at L2 Lagrange point (1.5 million km from Earth!)
- Appears as a distant golden dot
- Moves with Earth around the Sun
- The largest and most distant satellite

### Starlink (Close to Earth)
- Small red satellites in low orbit
- Represent the mega-constellation
- Fast orbital speed (95 minutes)

## Satellite Orbits

```
Earth
  ├── 400-550 km: ISS, Hubble, Starlink (LEO - Low Earth Orbit)
  ├── 20,200 km: GPS (MEO - Medium Earth Orbit)  
  └── 1.5 million km: James Webb (L2 - Lagrange Point)
```

## Comparing Sizes

**Zoom in to see:**
- ISS is the largest (football field size!)
- Hubble is cylinder-shaped (like a bus)
- GPS satellites have distinctive antennas
- JWST has huge golden sunshield
- Starlink satellites are small and compact

## Fun Things to Try

1. **Follow the ISS**: 
   - Click ISS
   - Watch it complete a full orbit around Earth (fast in simulation)
   - See how it's always facing Earth

2. **Compare Orbits**:
   - Focus on ISS (close, fast orbit)
   - Then focus on GPS (medium distance, slower)
   - Then focus on JWST (very far, moves with Earth)

3. **Watch Earth from ISS View**:
   - Focus on ISS
   - Zoom in close
   - Rotate to see Earth from astronaut perspective!

4. **Satellite Parade**:
   - Speed up time (brightness slider affects time)
   - Watch all satellites orbit at once
   - See the different orbital speeds

## Troubleshooting

**"I can't see the satellites!"**
- They're VERY small compared to planets
- Look around Earth closely
- Use Space Explorer panel to click and auto-focus
- Try zooming in on Earth region

**"The satellite is moving away!"**
- This shouldn't happen - focus tracking is enabled
- Click "Reset View" button and try again
- Make sure you clicked the satellite (not empty space)

**"Where's the James Webb?"**
- It's VERY far from Earth (realistic!)
- Click it in Space Explorer panel
- Camera will fly out to show you
- It appears as a tiny golden dot

## Best Experience

1. Start with ISS (easiest to find and most interesting)
2. Zoom in CLOSE to see the solar panels
3. Rotate around to see all sides
4. Read the information panel
5. Try the other satellites!

## Real-Time Info Display

When you click a satellite, you'll see:

```
🛰️ Name: ISS (International Space Station)
📊 Type: Satellite
📏 Size: 109m × 73m
🎯 Altitude: 408 km
⏱️ Orbital Period: 90 minutes
🚀 Speed: 27,600 km/h

Description:
The ISS is a habitable space station orbiting Earth...

Fun Fact:
The ISS is as long as a football field and can be 
seen with the naked eye from Earth!
