## Known Limitations

1. **Panel Persistence:** Panel positions reset on page reload
   - *Future:* Could save positions to localStorage

2. **Multi-Touch:** Only one panel can be dragged at a time
   - *This is intentional for usability*

3. **Horizontal Scroll:** Mobile bars may require horizontal scrolling with many buttons
   - *Trade-off for single-line layout*

4. **Translation Keys:** Some button text changes may need i18n updates
   - *"Stars", "Scale", "Labels" should be translated*

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Position Memory:**
   - Save panel positions to localStorage
   - Restore positions on reload

2. **Snap-to-Grid:**
   - Optional grid snapping for aligned panels
   - Corner snap zones

3. **Minimize/Collapse:**
   - Minimize panels to small icons
   - Click icon to restore

4. **More Panels:**
   - Settings panel (brightness, effects)
   - Help/tutorial panel
   - Object list panel

5. **Custom Layouts:**
   - Save/load layout presets
   - Mobile vs desktop layouts

6. **Gestures:**
   - Double-tap to center panel
   - Pinch to resize panels
