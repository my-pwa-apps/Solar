# ISS Cache Issue Resolution

## Problem
Browser is showing old cached ISS instead of new 17-module version.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Cache Buster
Changed version in `index.html` from:
- `src/main.js?v=20251007-2315` 
- To: `src/main.js?v=20251009-1600`

### 2. Added Prominent Debug Logging
Added large console message when creating new ISS to confirm it's being built.

## How to Fix (Do This Now!)

### Step 1: Hard Reload the Page
Choose ONE of these methods:

**Windows/Linux:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard reload)
- OR `Ctrl + F5`

**Mac:**
- Press `Cmd + Shift + R`

**Alternative - Clear Cache:**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Right-click the reload button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Step 2: Verify New ISS is Loading
Open Console (F12) and look for:
```
üöÄüõ∞Ô∏è ===============================================
üöÄüõ∞Ô∏è CREATING NEW ISS WITH ALL 17 MODULES!!!
üöÄüõ∞Ô∏è ===============================================
üõ∞Ô∏è ISS created with XX mesh components (scale: 0.0003)
   - 17 pressurized modules, 8 solar arrays, 6 radiators, 3 robotic arms
```

If you see this message, the new ISS is loading!

### Step 3: Find the ISS
1. Look near Earth
2. Zoom in toward Earth
3. Look for a **bright gold glowing sphere** orbiting just above Earth
4. Or click "ISS (International Space Station)" in the Explorer panel

## Still See Old ISS?

If you still see a simple single-module ISS after hard reload:

1. **Check Console** - Do you see the "CREATING NEW ISS" message?
   - **YES** = Cache cleared, but scale might still be wrong
   - **NO** = Browser still using old cache

2. **If NO message**, try:
   - Close ALL browser tabs/windows
   - Restart browser completely
   - Open page fresh
   - Check console again

3. **If YES message but still wrong**:
   - The ISS IS the new one, just looks similar from far away
   - Zoom in VERY close to see all the modules
   - Use the focus feature: Click ISS in Explorer panel

## What You Should See (New ISS)
- 17 separate cylindrical modules
- 8 large blue solar panel arrays (4 on each side)
- 6 radiator panels
- 3 robotic arm segments
- Gold center marker
- White visibility glow
- Russian modules have gold/bronze color
- Much more complex than single module

## What Old ISS Looked Like
- 1 or 2 simple modules
- 2 or 4 basic solar panels
- Very simple structure
- No robotic arms
- No radiators
