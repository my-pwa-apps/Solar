## Procedural Textures

In addition to photographic textures, this project includes procedurally generated textures created by the application itself using:
- **Three.js** (MIT License) - WebGL rendering
- **Canvas API** - Procedural generation algorithms
- **Custom algorithms** - Fractal noise, Perlin noise, etc.

These procedural textures serve as fallbacks when network textures fail to load or for planets without photographic data.
