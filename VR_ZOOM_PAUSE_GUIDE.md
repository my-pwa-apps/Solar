- A: Make sure laser is GREEN (pointing at object)
- Hold GRIP first, THEN pull trigger
- Both buttons must be pressed simultaneously

**Q: Can't pause rotation?**
- A: Use VR menu Pause button
- Or press SPACE on keyboard
- Check time speed isn't at 0 already

**Q: Zoomed too close, can't see?**
- A: Hold trigger and fly backward (left thumbstick back)
- Or use normal Point+Trigger for wider view

**Q: Lost track of focused object?**
- A: Use keyboard shortcuts (I/M/V/P/L)
