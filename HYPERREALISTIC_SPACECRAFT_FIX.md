# Hyperrealistic Spacecraft Fix

## Issue
The user requested that JWST, Voyager, Pioneer, Juno, and Cassini spacecraft should be hyperrealistic, matching the quality of Hubble and ISS implementations.

## Root Cause Analysis

Upon investigation, I discovered that:

1. **Hyperrealistic functions already existed** for all requested spacecraft:
   - `createHyperrealisticVoyager()` (line 4667)
   - `createHyperrealisticPioneer()` (line 4618)
   - `createHyperrealisticJuno()` (line 4812)
   - `createHyperrealisticCassini()` (line 4742)
   - `createHyperrealisticJWST()` (line 4581)
   - Also: `createHyperrealisticNewHorizons()` (line 4900)

2. **The functions were never being called** - The `createSpacecraft()` function (starting at line 5419) was creating generic spacecraft models for ALL spacecraft, ignoring the existing hyperrealistic implementations.

3. **Satellites used the routing logic correctly** - The `createSatellites()` function (line 5330) properly checked spacecraft names and routed to hyperrealistic functions.

## Solution

Added spacecraft name routing logic to `createSpacecraft()` function to match the pattern used in `createSatellites()`:

### Changes Made to `SolarSystemModule.js`

**Location**: Line 5539-5556 (previously line 5539-5541)

**Before**:
```javascript
spacecraftData.forEach(craft => {
    // Create HYPER-REALISTIC spacecraft with detailed geometry
    const spacecraftGroup = new THREE.Group();
    
    // Main body - octagonal/box shape for probes
    if (craft.type === 'probe' || craft.type === 'orbiter') {
```

**After**:
```javascript
spacecraftData.forEach(craft => {
    let spacecraftGroup;
    
    // Check if this spacecraft has a hyperrealistic model
    if (craft.name.includes('Voyager')) {
        spacecraftGroup = this.createHyperrealisticVoyager(craft);
    } else if (craft.name.includes('Pioneer')) {
        spacecraftGroup = this.createHyperrealisticPioneer(craft);
    } else if (craft.name.includes('Juno')) {
        spacecraftGroup = this.createHyperrealisticJuno(craft);
    } else if (craft.name.includes('Cassini')) {
        spacecraftGroup = this.createHyperrealisticCassini(craft);
    } else if (craft.name.includes('James Webb')) {
        spacecraftGroup = this.createHyperrealisticJWST(craft);
    } else if (craft.name.includes('New Horizons')) {
        spacecraftGroup = this.createHyperrealisticNewHorizons(craft);
    } else {
        // Create GENERIC spacecraft with detailed geometry for others
        spacecraftGroup = new THREE.Group();
        
        // Main body - octagonal/box shape for probes
        if (craft.type === 'probe' || craft.type === 'orbiter') {
```

**Location**: Line 5681 - Added closing brace for else block

**Added**:
```javascript
    } // End of generic spacecraft creation else block
```

## Spacecraft Affected

### Deep Space Probes (not orbiting planets):
1. **Voyager 1** - Now using hyperrealistic model with 3.7m white dish, science boom (13m), magnetometer boom (13m), 3 RTGs, and Golden Record
2. **Voyager 2** - Same hyperrealistic Voyager model
3. **Pioneer 10** - Now using hyperrealistic model with 2.74m dish, hexagonal bus, RTG, 6.6m magnetometer boom
4. **Pioneer 11** - Same hyperrealistic Pioneer model
5. **New Horizons** - Already had hyperrealistic model, now properly called

### Planetary Orbiters:
6. **Juno (Jupiter)** - Now using hyperrealistic model with 3 massive 9m√ó2.7m solar panels, hexagonal body, 2.5m antenna, JunoCam, magnetometer boom, 6 microwave radiometer antennas
7. **Cassini-Huygens Legacy (Saturn)** - Now using hyperrealistic model with 6.8m tall bus, 4m white dish, 11m magnetometer boom, 3 RTG units (16m each!), Huygens probe

### Satellites (already working):
8. **James Webb Space Telescope** (at Earth L2) - Already had hyperrealistic routing in satellites, now also works in spacecraft

## Hyperrealistic Features

Each spacecraft now renders with:
- **Accurate proportions** based on real dimensions
- **Realistic materials**:
  - Gold foil (`0xD4AF37`) with metalness 0.9, roughness 0.2
  - Silver (`0xC0C0C0`) with metalness 0.9, roughness 0.3
  - Dark instruments (`0x2a2a2a`) with metalness 0.7, roughness 0.4
  - White antennas (`0xFFFFFF`) with metalness 0.9, roughness 0.2
  - Solar panels (`0x0a1a3d`) with emissive glow
- **Component-level detail**:
  - High-gain antenna dishes with proper geometry
  - RTG booms and power units (with emissive glow)
  - Magnetometer booms extending to correct lengths
  - Science instrument platforms
  - Solar panel arrays with frames and grid lines
- **Realistic geometry complexity**:
  - 32-segment cylindrical dishes
  - Hexagonal spacecraft buses
  - Detailed structural elements

## Testing Recommendations

1. Navigate to each spacecraft using keyboard shortcuts (v for Voyager, etc.)
2. Zoom in close to verify detailed geometry is visible
3. Check that materials reflect light realistically
4. Verify spacecraft are positioned correctly in their orbits
5. Confirm no performance degradation with detailed models

## Result

All 5 requested spacecraft (plus New Horizons) now use their hyperrealistic implementations, matching the quality level of ISS and Hubble. The generic spacecraft creation code is only used for spacecraft that don't have dedicated hyperrealistic models (GPS, Starlink, etc.).

## Files Modified

- `src/modules/SolarSystemModule.js` - Added routing logic at line 5539-5556, added closing brace at line 5681
