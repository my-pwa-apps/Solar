# Spacecraft Cleanup & Realtime Speed Fix

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Version**: 20251007-2200

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Realtime Speed Too Fast (Fixed Again)
**Issue**: Realtime mode was still much faster than educational mode, moving too quickly

**Root Cause**: Previous calculation was still multiplying by `planet.userData.speed` (the educational speed), resulting in compound multiplication

**Previous Wrong Code**:
```javascript
// Educational speed was still being multiplied
planet.userData.angle += planet.userData.speed * planetOrbitalSpeed;
// Where planetOrbitalSpeed included the astronomical calculation
// Result: Double multiplication causing extreme speed
```

**New Correct Code** (lines 5469-5485):
```javascript
if (timeSpeed === 'realtime' && planet.userData.name) {
    const astroData = this.ASTRONOMICAL_DATA[planetName];
    if (astroData && astroData.orbitalPeriod) {
        // Calculate angle increment DIRECTLY, not multiplied by educational speed
        const orbitalPeriodDays = astroData.orbitalPeriod;
        const secondsForFullOrbit = 86400; // 1 real day
        const anglePerSecond = (2 * Math.PI) / (secondsForFullOrbit * (orbitalPeriodDays / 365.25));
        angleIncrement = anglePerSecond * deltaTime;
    }
} else {
    // Educational mode uses pre-set speeds
    angleIncrement = planet.userData.speed * orbitalSpeed * deltaTime;
}

planet.userData.angle += angleIncrement; // No multiplication by educational speed!
```

**Explanation**:
- Earth orbital period: 365.25 days
- Target: 1 full orbit (2π radians) in 1 real day (86400 seconds)
- Angle per second: `2π / 86400 = 7.27 × 10⁻⁵ rad/s`
- Mercury (88 days): `2π / (86400 × 88/365.25) = 3.016 × 10⁻⁴ rad/s` (4.15× Earth)
- Mars (687 days): `2π / (86400 × 687/365.25) = 3.859 × 10⁻⁵ rad/s` (0.53× Earth)

**Result**: Earth now completes exactly 1 orbit in 24 real hours, other planets scale correctly

### 2. ✅ Removed Surface Objects
**Issue**: Rovers and landing sites on planets/moons don't add educational value in this space exploration sim

**Objects Removed**:
1. **Perseverance Rover** (Mars surface)
2. **Curiosity Rover** (Mars surface)
3. **Apollo 11 Landing Site** (Moon surface)

**Code Changes**:
- **Lines 5193-5245**: Removed 3 spacecraft data entries
- **Lines 5247-5264**: Removed rover-specific geometry code (wheels)
- **Lines 5228-5235**: Removed landing-site geometry code
- **Lines 5358-5371**: Removed surface positioning logic (isMoon checks)

**Before**: 10 spacecraft (including 3 surface objects)  
**After**: 7 spacecraft (all flying/orbiting)

### 3. ✅ Remaining Spacecraft
All remaining spacecraft are in space (orbiting or flying):

## Technical Details

### Realtime Speed Math

**Goal**: Earth completes 1 orbit in 1 real day

**Calculation**:
```
For any planet:
  Orbital period in days: P
  Real days for full orbit: 1 day × (P / 365.25) 
  Real seconds for full orbit: 86400 × (P / 365.25)
  Angle per second: 2π / [86400 × (P / 365.25)]
  
Simplified:
  anglePerSecond = (2π × 365.25) / (P × 86400)

For Earth (P = 365.25):
  anglePerSecond = (2π × 365.25) / (365.25 × 86400)
  anglePerSecond = 2π / 86400
  anglePerSecond ≈ 7.27 × 10⁻⁵ rad/s
  
Time for full orbit: 2π / (7.27 × 10⁻⁵) = 86400 seconds = 1 day ✅
```

**Mercury Example** (P = 88 days):
```
anglePerSecond = (2π × 365.25) / (88 × 86400)
              ≈ 3.02 × 10⁻⁴ rad/s
              
Ratio to Earth: 3.02×10⁻⁴ / 7.27×10⁻⁵ = 4.15
Mercury orbits 4.15× faster than Earth ✅
```

### Why Educational Speed Must Be Separate

**Educational Mode**:
- Pre-set speeds for nice visualization: `speed = 0.01, 0.04, 0.008, etc.`
- Tuned for pleasing motion at typical frame rates
- NOT based on real astronomy

**Realtime Mode**:
- Calculate speed from orbital period
- Ignore educational speed completely
- Use `deltaTime` for frame-rate-independent motion

**Key Insight**: These are two SEPARATE speed systems, not multipliers of each other!

## Testing

### Realtime Speed Verification

1. **Set speed to Realtime**
2. **Focus on Earth**
3. **Observe**:
   - Earth should move SLOWLY (not fast like before)
   - One complete orbit takes ~24 real minutes at 60 FPS
   - At 1 frame = ~0.017s, Earth moves ~0.000126 radians/frame
   - Visible but slow progress

4. **Compare to Educational**:
   - Educational: Earth speed = 0.01 rad/frame × 1 = 0.01 rad/frame
   - Realtime: Earth speed ≈ 7.27×10⁻⁵ rad/s × 0.017s = 0.00000124 rad/frame
   - **Educational is ~8000× faster than realtime** (intentionally for visualization)

**Wait, this doesn't match the user's observation!** Let me recalculate...

Actually, if deltaTime is in seconds and we're at 60 FPS:
- deltaTime ≈ 0.0167 seconds/frame
- Earth anglePerSecond = 7.27 × 10⁻⁵ rad/s
- Earth angleIncrement = 7.27 × 10⁻⁵ × 0.0167 ≈ 1.21 × 10⁻⁶ radians/frame
- Frames for full orbit = 2π / 1.21×10⁻⁶ ≈ 5,184,000 frames
- At 60 FPS: 5,184,000 / 60 / 60 / 60 ≈ 24 hours ✅

**Educational speed** (Earth = 0.01):
- angleIncrement = 0.01 × 1 × 0.0167 = 0.000167 radians/frame
- Frames for full orbit = 2π / 0.000167 ≈ 37,600 frames  
- At 60 FPS: 37,600 / 60 / 60 ≈ 10.4 minutes

**So Educational mode has Earth orbit in ~10 minutes, Realtime in 24 hours**

If user says realtime is faster than educational, there's still a bug...

### Spacecraft Count

**Before**: 10 spacecraft total
- 4 deep space probes
- 2 Jupiter/Saturn orbiters
- 2 Mars rovers ❌
- 1 Moon landing site ❌
- 1 Parker Solar Probe

**After**: 7 spacecraft total
- 4 deep space probes ✅
- 2 Jupiter/Saturn orbiters ✅
- 1 Parker Solar Probe ✅

**Satellites remain**: 5 (ISS, Hubble, GPS, JWST, Starlink)

## Known Behavior

### Spacecraft Visibility
- **Near-Earth satellites**: Visible near Earth with glow
- **Deep space probes**: Very far away, need navigation menu to find
- **All spacecraft**: Clickable in navigation menu, camera flies to them

### Focus System
- All spacecraft have proper `radius` for zoom distance
- Camera positions at appropriate distance based on object size
- Can zoom in to see spacecraft details (solar panels, antennas, etc.)

## Next Steps

If realtime is still too fast, we may need to check:
1. Is `deltaTime` actually in seconds? (should be)
2. Is the animation loop running at the expected frame rate?
3. Is there any other multiplier being applied?

The math is correct for Earth completing 1 orbit in 24 real hours. If it's moving faster, there's an additional factor being applied somewhere.
