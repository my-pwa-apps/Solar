# ISS Zoom Fix - October 9, 2025

## Problem
Could see ISS but couldn't zoom in close enough to see the detailed modules.

## Changes Made

### 1. Camera Controls - Minimum Distance
**Changed:** `minDistance: 5`  
**To:** `minDistance: 0.001`  
**Effect:** Can now zoom in 5000x closer! Allows extreme close-up views

### 2. ISS Scale Increased
**Changed:** `scale = 0.0003`  
**To:** `scale = 0.001`  
**Effect:** ISS is now 3.3x larger, easier to see all the modules

### 3. Cache Buster Updated
**Changed:** `v=20251009-1600`  
**To:** `v=20251009-1630`  
**Effect:** Forces browser to reload new code

## How to Apply Fix

### Quick Method:
1. **Hard Reload:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac)
2. **Focus on ISS:** Click "ISS (International Space Station)" in Explorer panel
3. **Zoom In:** Use mouse wheel to zoom in VERY close
4. **Rotate:** Click and drag to rotate around ISS

### Full Method (if server is running):
1. Stop server: `Ctrl + C` in PowerShell
2. Hard reload browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
3. Restart server: `.\start-server.ps1`
4. Focus on ISS and zoom in

## What You Should Now See

### When Zoomed In Close:
- ✅ **17 individual cylindrical modules**
- ✅ **8 large blue solar arrays** (4 on each side, wings spread out)
- ✅ **6 white/silver radiator panels**
- ✅ **3 robotic arms:**
  - Canadarm2 (long arm)
  - Dextre (shorter manipulator)
  - JEM RMS (Japanese arm)
- ✅ **Color coding:**
  - Russian modules: Gold/bronze
  - US/International modules: White/silver
  - Solar panels: Dark blue
  - Radiators: Light silver
- ✅ **Main truss structure** running through the center
- ✅ **Detailed module connections and docking ports**

### Module Details You Can See:
**Russian Segment (Gold/Bronze):**
- Zarya (aft)
- Zvezda (living quarters)
- Nauka (new lab)
- Poisk, Rassvet, Prichal (docking modules)

**US Segment (Silver/White):**
- Unity, Harmony, Tranquility (nodes)
- Destiny (US lab)
- Quest (airlock)
- Leonardo (storage)
- Cupola (observation dome)

**International:**
- Columbus (ESA)
- Kibo (JAXA - 3 parts)
- BEAM (expandable)

## Zoom Controls

### Mouse:
- **Scroll Wheel:** Zoom in/out
- **Left Click + Drag:** Rotate around object
- **Right Click + Drag:** Pan camera
- **Middle Click + Drag:** Pan (alternative)

### Keyboard Shortcuts:
- **I:** Focus on ISS (if shortcut configured)
- **R:** Reset camera
- **+/-:** Adjust time speed

## Tips for Best Viewing

1. **Click ISS in Explorer panel first** - this focuses camera on it
2. **Zoom in slowly** - you can get VERY close now
3. **Rotate while zoomed** - see ISS from all angles
4. **Look for the gold modules** - Russian segment
5. **Count the solar arrays** - should see 8 large panels
6. **Find the robotic arms** - extending from various modules

## Technical Details

### New Zoom Capability:
- **Old minimum distance:** 5 units (couldn't get close)
- **New minimum distance:** 0.001 units (can zoom to microscopic detail)
- **Zoom improvement:** 5,000x closer!

### ISS Size:
- **Old scale:** 0.0003 (hard to see details)
- **New scale:** 0.001 (clear module definition)
- **Size increase:** 3.3x larger

### Real ISS Dimensions:
- **Length:** 109m (357 feet)
- **Width:** 73m (240 feet) with solar arrays
- **Height:** 20m (66 feet)
- **Mass:** 419,725 kg (925,335 lbs)

## Troubleshooting

### Still Can't Zoom In?
1. Make sure you did HARD RELOAD (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check console - should see minimum distance = 0.001
3. Try clicking ISS in Explorer first, then zoom

### ISS Looks Blurry When Close?
- This is normal - modules are simple geometric shapes
- Look for overall structure and component count
- Compare to old ISS (single box) - much more complex now

### Can't Find ISS?
1. Click "ISS (International Space Station)" in Explorer panel (left side)
2. Camera will auto-focus on it
3. Then use mouse wheel to zoom in
