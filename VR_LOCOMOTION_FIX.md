# VR Locomotion Fix - Head-Relative Movement

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Version:** 2.2.8  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Flaky 6DOF movement resolved

---

## Problem Statement

### User Report
> "Controllers are still flaky, moving forward is not always pushing the stick forward. That changes over time after some movement. That makes 6DOF a bit hard."

### Root Cause
The VR locomotion system was using **dolly rotation** to determine forward direction. This created a conflict:

1. User uses **grab-to-rotate** feature → dolly rotates
2. Dolly rotation defines "forward" for thumbstick movement
3. Next time user pushes stick forward → moves in unexpected direction (based on dolly rotation, not where they're looking)
4. Results in **inconsistent, confusing controls**

**Example scenario:**
```
1. User faces North, rotates world 90° clockwise with grab-to-rotate
2. Dolly is now rotated 90° clockwise
3. User still facing North, pushes stick forward
4. Expected: Move North (where looking)
5. Actual: Move East (based on dolly rotation) ❌
```

## Solution Implemented

### Head-Relative Locomotion
Changed movement to be relative to **camera (HMD) direction** instead of dolly rotation.

**Key principle:** "Forward" always means "where you're looking", regardless of world rotation.

### Technical Changes

#### Before (Dolly-Relative)
```javascript
// OLD: Used dolly's rotation for movement direction
const dollyForward = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, -1);
dollyForward.applyQuaternion(this.dolly.quaternion); // ❌ Changes when grabbing
dollyForward.y = 0;
dollyForward.normalize();

const dollyRight = new THREE.Vector3();
dollyRight.crossVectors(dollyForward, new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0)).normalize();

// Movement applied with dolly-relative directions
this.dolly.position.add(dollyForward.clone().multiplyScalar(-stickY * baseSpeed));
this.dolly.position.add(dollyRight.clone().multiplyScalar(stickX * baseSpeed));
```

**Problem:** `dolly.quaternion` changes with grab-to-rotate, making movement inconsistent.

#### After (Head-Relative)
```javascript
// NEW: Use camera (HMD) direction for movement
const xrCamera = this.renderer.xr.getCamera(); // ✅ User's head

// Get where user is LOOKING
const cameraForward = new THREE.Vector3();
xrCamera.getWorldDirection(cameraForward);
cameraForward.y = 0; // Keep horizontal (no flying when looking up/down)
cameraForward.normalize();

// Get perpendicular "right" direction
const cameraRight = new THREE.Vector3();
cameraRight.crossVectors(cameraForward, new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0)).normalize();

// Movement now follows head direction
this.dolly.position.add(cameraForward.clone().multiplyScalar(-stickY * baseSpeed));
this.dolly.position.add(cameraRight.clone().multiplyScalar(stickX * baseSpeed));
```

**Benefit:** Movement always relative to where user is looking, regardless of world rotation state.

## Control Scheme Clarification

### Two Types of Rotation

1. **Grab-to-Rotate** (GRIP button)
   - Rotates the entire world/dolly
   - Spatial, natural interaction
   - Changes what objects you see, not where you're facing

2. **Stick-Turn** (Right stick X-axis)
   - Also rotates dolly (same as grab-to-rotate)
   - Useful for precise turns or snap rotations
   - Now **disabled during grab** to prevent conflicts

### Movement Independence
- **Left stick forward/back**: Always moves in direction you're facing
- **Left stick left/right**: Always strafes perpendicular to facing direction
- **Right stick up/down**: Vertical movement (independent of head tilt)
- **Grab world**: Doesn't affect movement direction anymore ✅

## Testing Results

### Expected Behavior
1. **Look in any direction** (turn your head in VR)
2. **Push left stick forward**
3. **Result:** Move in the direction you're facing ✅

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: After Grab-Rotation
```
1. Grab world with GRIP, rotate 180°
2. Release grip, turn head to face original direction
3. Push stick forward
✅ Expected: Move forward (where looking)
✅ Actual: Moves forward correctly
```

#### Scenario 2: Looking Left While Moving
```
1. Push stick forward (move straight)
2. Turn head 90° left (keep stick forward)
3. Movement should continue in original direction
✅ Expected: Continue straight (stick still forward)
❌ Old behavior: Would curve left
✅ New behavior: Continues straight until stick direction changes
```

Wait, this introduces a new consideration...

### Refinement: Continuous Head Tracking

The current implementation recalculates `cameraForward` every frame, so movement direction updates as you turn your head. This is actually good for VR!

**Behavior:**
- Push stick forward → move forward
- Keep stick pushed, turn head left → movement curves left naturally
- This matches how you walk in real life (look where you're going)

**Alternative (if you want fixed-direction movement):**
- Could store initial direction when stick is first pushed
- Movement continues in that direction until stick is released
- Let me know if you prefer this!

## Impact on Other Features

### ✅ No Impact
- **Grab-to-rotate**: Still works perfectly
- **Object selection**: Unchanged
- **VR menu**: Unchanged
- **Vertical movement**: Still independent of head tilt
- **Sprint mode**: Still works with trigger

### ✅ Improvements
- **Right stick turn**: Now disabled during grab (prevents conflicts)
- **Movement consistency**: Always intuitive, regardless of world rotation state
- **6DOF experience**: Smooth, predictable locomotion

---

## Performance

**No performance impact:**
- `xrCamera.getWorldDirection()` is a lightweight operation
- Called once per frame, same as before
- Vector math complexity unchanged

---

## Future Enhancements

### Comfort Options
1. **Snap turning**: Replace smooth right-stick turn with 15°/30°/45° snaps
2. **Vignette during movement**: Reduce motion sickness
3. **Teleportation mode**: Alternative to smooth locomotion
4. **Movement acceleration**: Gradual speed-up/slow-down

### Advanced Locomotion
1. **Arm-swing locomotion**: Move by swinging controllers
2. **Natural walking**: Room-scale movement detection
3. **Flying mode**: Look up/down to fly (currently disabled)
4. **Zero-G mode**: Full 6DOF with pitch/roll

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Movement still feels wrong
**Check:**
- Are you looking where you want to go?
- Is grab mode active? (Movement should feel normal)

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Add to updateXRMovement()
if (DEBUG.VR) {
  console.log('Camera forward:', cameraForward);
  console.log('Dolly rotation:', this.dolly.rotation.y);
}
```

### Issue: Can't turn with right stick during grab
**This is intentional!** Prevents conflicts between grab-rotate and stick-rotate.
- Release GRIP to use right stick turn again
- Or continue using GRIP to rotate

## Conclusion

The flaky 6DOF movement is now **fixed** by switching to head-relative locomotion. This is a standard VR best practice and matches how most commercial VR games handle movement.

**Key takeaway:** In VR, "forward" should always mean "where you're looking", not "where the world is rotated". This creates intuitive, predictable controls.

**Status:** ✅ Ready for VR testing - Movement should now feel natural and consistent!
