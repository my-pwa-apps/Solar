## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)
```powershell
# If using Netlify CLI
netlify deploy --prod

# Or simply push to Git (if auto-deploy enabled)
git add .
git commit -m "Mobile layout optimization: responsive breakpoints, touch-friendly controls, SW v2.1.7"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Vercel
```powershell
# If using Vercel CLI
vercel --prod

# Or push to Git (auto-deploy)
git add .
git commit -m "Mobile layout optimization: responsive breakpoints, touch-friendly controls, SW v2.1.7"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Manual Upload
1. Upload all modified files to your web server:
   - `src/styles/ui.css`
   - `src/styles/main.css`
   - `sw.js`
   - `MOBILE_OPTIMIZATION_COMPLETE.md` (documentation)

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Immediate Checks (within 5 minutes)
1. **Service Worker Update:**
   - [ ] Open the app in a browser where it's already installed
   - [ ] Check DevTools Console for "New service worker available"
   - [ ] Verify update notification appears
   - [ ] Click "Update" button to refresh
   - [ ] Confirm new version (2.1.7) in DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Service Workers

2. **Mobile Responsive Layout:**
   - [ ] Open DevTools â†’ Toggle device toolbar
   - [ ] Test iPhone SE (375px) - extra small breakpoint
   - [ ] Test iPhone 12 (390px) - standard mobile
   - [ ] Test iPad Mini (768px) - tablet breakpoint
   - [ ] Verify header wraps properly
   - [ ] Verify footer is in column layout
   - [ ] Verify PWA UI is at bottom

3. **Touch Interactions:**
   - [ ] Tap all buttons (no double-tap zoom delay)
   - [ ] Verify no blue tap highlight flash
   - [ ] Confirm no text selection when tapping controls
   - [ ] Test canvas pan/pinch (should be smooth)

### Device Testing (within 24 hours)
Test on **real physical devices** (emulators don't perfectly replicate touch behavior):

**iOS Devices:**
- [ ] iPhone SE (2nd/3rd gen) - Safari
- [ ] iPhone 12/13/14 - Safari
- [ ] iPhone 14 Pro Max (notch) - Safari
- [ ] iPad Mini - Safari

**Android Devices:**
- [ ] Samsung Galaxy S21/S22 - Chrome
- [ ] Google Pixel 5/6 - Chrome
- [ ] OnePlus 9 - Chrome
- [ ] Any tablet - Chrome

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Open in browser (not installed)
2. Install as PWA
3. Open from home screen
4. Navigate between objects
5. Toggle VR/AR buttons
6. Change scale/speed settings
7. Open info panel and close
8. Test in landscape and portrait
9. Check notch/hole-punch overlap

## Rollback Plan (If Issues Arise)

### Quick Rollback
If critical issues are discovered:

```powershell
# Revert to previous service worker version
# Edit sw.js:
# Change CACHE_VERSION from '2.1.7' back to '2.1.6'

# Revert CSS changes
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or restore from backup
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/styles/ui.css
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/styles/main.css
git checkout HEAD~1 -- sw.js
git add .
git commit -m "Rollback: Revert mobile optimization due to [ISSUE]"
git push origin main
```

### Known Safe Fallback
- Previous working version: **2.1.6**
- Previous commit: Check `git log` for "Bump service worker version to 2.1.6"

---

## Monitoring

### Analytics to Watch (First 7 Days)
- **Mobile Bounce Rate:** Should decrease by 10-20%
- **Session Duration (Mobile):** Should increase
- **PWA Install Rate:** Should increase (better install prompt visibility)
- **Page Load Time (Mobile):** Should remain <3s on 3G

### User Feedback Channels
- GitHub Issues: Monitor for mobile-specific reports
- Twitter/Social: Search for "@YourApp mobile"
- Direct Feedback: Check any contact forms

### DevTools Monitoring
- Lighthouse Score (Mobile): Target 95+
- Core Web Vitals:
  - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): <2.5s
  - FID (First Input Delay): <100ms
  - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): <0.1

## Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- âœ… Mobile users can easily tap all controls (no mis-taps)
- âœ… PWA install prompt is visible and accessible
- âœ… Layout doesn't force horizontal scrolling
- âœ… Touch interactions feel native (no delays)

### Secondary Goals
- âœ… Service worker updates deploy immediately
- âœ… Notched devices don't hide UI elements
- âœ… Landscape orientation remains usable
- âœ… Accessibility standards maintained (WCAG AA/AAA)
