# 🚀 VR/AR Educational Solar System Controls

## Full 6DOF Movement System (Quest 3S)

### LEFT CONTROLLER - Movement
**Thumbstick:**
- **Push Forward/Back**: Move forward/backward through space
- **Push Left/Right**: Strafe left/right

**Buttons:**
- **X Button (hold)**: Move DOWN vertically
- **Y Button (hold)**: Move UP vertically

### RIGHT CONTROLLER - Navigation
**Thumbstick:**
- **Push Left/Right**: Rotate view (snap turning)
- **Push Up/Down**: Move UP/DOWN vertically

**Buttons:**
- **A Button (hold)**: Move DOWN vertically (alternative)
- **B Button (hold)**: Move UP vertically (alternative)

### SPRINT MODE 🚀
**Hold ANY TRIGGER button** while moving to activate **3x speed boost**
- Visual feedback: Laser pointers turn **ORANGE** during sprint
- Perfect for quickly traversing large distances between planets

### LASER POINTERS
- **CYAN**: Normal mode, not pointing at anything
- **GREEN**: Pointing at a planet or object (ready to select)
- **ORANGE**: Sprint mode active (3x speed)

### INTERACTIONS

**🎯 Trigger Button (Pull)**: 
- Point at planet/object + Pull trigger = **Select and focus**
- **Hold GRIP + Pull TRIGGER** = **Zoom VERY close for inspection** 🔍
- Point at VR menu button + Pull trigger = Activate button
- Hold trigger while moving = Sprint mode (3x speed)

**🤏 Grip Button (Squeeze)**:
- Squeeze grip alone = Toggle VR menu panel on/off
- **Hold GRIP + Pull TRIGGER** while pointing = **Zoom close inspection** 🔍

**📋 VR Menu Controls:**
- **⏸️ Pause** - Freeze all rotation/motion for inspection
- **▶️ Play** - Resume motion at 1x speed
- **⏩ Speed+** - Increase time speed (up to 10x)
- **⏪ Speed-** - Decrease time speed (down to 0)
- **🔆 Bright+** - Increase scene brightness
- **🔅 Bright-** - Decrease scene brightness
- **☄️ Tails** - Toggle comet tails on/off
- **📏 Scale** - Toggle realistic/educational scale
- **🔄 Reset** - Reset camera to starting position
- **🌍 Earth** - Jump to Earth instantly

## Day/Night Cycle

Earth now features:
- Realistic rotation speed (0.02 rad/frame)
- Enhanced lighting from the sun (PointLight intensity: 8)
- Ambient space light for visibility (0.3 intensity)
- Realistic shadows showing day/night terminator
- Improved material settings for surface detail visibility

Watch as Earth rotates to observe the day/night cycle from any angle!

## Educational Features

### Improved Visibility
- **Sun brightness**: Increased to 8 for better planet illumination
- **Earth emissive glow**: Boosted to 0.15 for atmosphere visibility
- **Ambient light**: Added soft blue ambient (0.3) for dark-side visibility
- **Material refinement**: Reduced roughness to 0.5, increased metalness to 0.1

### Realistic Textures
All planets feature:
- 2048x2048 procedural textures
- Multi-octave turbulence algorithms
- Normal maps for surface detail
- Bump maps for elevation
- Specular maps for reflectivity
- NASA-quality visual fidelity

### Realistic Sizes (Earth = 1.0 base)
- **Sun**: 15.0 units (scaled for visibility)
- **Jupiter**: 10.97x Earth
- **Saturn**: 9.14x Earth  
- **Earth**: 1.0x (reference)
- **Mars**: 0.532x Earth
- **Mercury**: 0.383x Earth
- **Comets**: 0.001-0.005x Earth

## Movement Tips

1. **Exploring Planets**: Use normal speed (no trigger) for precise inspection
2. **Traversing Space**: Hold trigger for 3x sprint between distant objects
3. **Vertical Control**: Multiple options - use what feels most natural:
   - Right stick Y-axis for smooth vertical glide
   - X/Y buttons on left controller
   - A/B buttons on right controller
4. **Free Flight**: You can now move in ANY direction - truly explore 3D space!
5. **Inspection**: Get VERY close to planets to see surface details and textures

## Troubleshooting

**Can't move vertically?**
- Try right thumbstick up/down
- Try holding X/Y buttons
- Check console logs for "Moving: Y=" values

**Earth looks dark?**
- Check you're facing the sunlit side
- Rotate around Earth to see day/night terminator
- Emissive glow should make it visible even from dark side

**Want to move faster?**
- Hold ANY trigger button while using thumbsticks
- Lasers will turn orange to confirm sprint mode

**Lost in space?**
- Use grip button to open VR menu
- Press "Reset Camera" button to return to start position
- Or select "Earth" to focus on our home planet

## Console Commands (Development)

The system logs useful debug information:
- `🚀 SPRINT MODE ACTIVATED` - When sprint is triggered
- `🚶 Normal Moving` / `🚀 SPRINT Moving` - Position updates
- `🎮 Controller axes` - Input values from controllers

Check browser console (F12) if experiencing issues.
