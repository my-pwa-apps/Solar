# 🚨 URGENT: Steps to See New ISS 🚨

## The Problem
Your browser is showing the OLD cached ISS (simple single module) instead of the NEW ISS (17 modules).

## The Solution - Follow These Steps IN ORDER:

### ✅ Step 1: Stop the Server
**If you have a server running:**
1. Go to the PowerShell terminal where server is running
2. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop it

### ✅ Step 2: Hard Reload Browser FIRST
**Before restarting server, do this:**
1. In your browser, press **`Ctrl + Shift + R`** (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac)
2. This forces browser to ignore ALL cached files

### ✅ Step 3: Start Server Fresh
In PowerShell terminal, run:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\bartm\OneDrive - Microsoft\Documents\Git Repos\Solar"
.\start-server.ps1
```

### ✅ Step 4: Verify New ISS is Loading
1. Open Browser Console (press `F12`, then click "Console" tab)
2. Look for these messages:
```
🚀🛰️ ===============================================
🚀🛰️ CREATING NEW ISS WITH ALL 17 MODULES!!!
🚀🛰️ ===============================================
```
3. Then you should see:
```
🛰️ ISS created with 50+ mesh components (scale: 0.0003)
   - 17 pressurized modules, 8 solar arrays, 6 radiators, 3 robotic arms
```

### ✅ Step 5: Find and View the ISS

**Method 1 - Use Explorer Panel:**
1. Look at the left side panel "🔍 Explore"
2. Click on **"ISS (International Space Station)"**
3. Camera will focus on ISS automatically

**Method 2 - Manual Search:**
1. Find Earth (blue planet)
2. Zoom in close to Earth
3. Look for a **bright gold glowing dot** orbiting near Earth
4. That's the ISS!

## 🔍 How to Tell Old vs New ISS

### OLD ISS (What you're seeing now):
- ❌ 1-2 simple rectangular modules
- ❌ 2-4 basic solar panels
- ❌ Very simple, blocky appearance
- ❌ All silver/white

### NEW ISS (What you should see):
- ✅ 17 separate cylindrical modules
- ✅ 8 large blue solar arrays (wings)
- ✅ 6 radiator panels
- ✅ 3 robotic arms
- ✅ Complex structure
- ✅ Russian modules are gold/bronze colored
- ✅ US modules are silver/white
- ✅ Much more detail when zoomed in

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Try This:
1. **Close ALL browser tabs and windows**
2. **Restart browser completely**
3. **Clear ALL browser cache:**
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Cached images and files
   - Firefox: Settings → Privacy → Clear Data → Cached Web Content
   - Edge: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Cached images and files
4. **Restart server**
5. **Open page fresh**

### Check Console for Errors:
If you see ANY errors in console mentioning ISS or createHyperrealisticISS, report them.

## 📊 Quick Test

**Type this in Console (F12):**
```javascript
app.solarSystemModule.satellites.find(s => s.userData.name.includes('ISS')).children.length
```

**Expected result:**
- OLD ISS: 3-5 children
- NEW ISS: 50+ children

If you get 50+, you have the new ISS! Just need to find it.

## 🎯 TL;DR - Quick Fix:
1. Stop server (Ctrl+C)
2. Hard reload browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Restart server (.\start-server.ps1)
