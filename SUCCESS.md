## 🎨 Customization Ideas

Want to add more? Here are some ideas:

### Add More Planets
Edit `src/main.js` and add Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc. in the `SolarSystemModule.init()` method.

### Change Colors
Edit `src/styles/ui.css` to change gradients, colors, and effects.

### Add More Topics
Create new module classes in `src/main.js` following the pattern of `QuantumModule`.

### Adjust Lighting
In `src/main.js`, find `setupLighting()` and tweak the light intensities.

## ❓ Need Help?

### Check Browser Console
Press **F12** to open developer tools and check for any errors.

### Common Issues

**Objects are black?**
→ Increase brightness slider to 70-100%

**Can't see anything?**
→ Try scrolling out (zoom out)
→ Click "Reset" button

**VR/AR buttons don't show?**
→ They only appear if WebXR is available
→ Try on a VR headset or AR device

**Performance is slow?**
→ Try closing other browser tabs
→ Check if hardware acceleration is enabled in browser settings
