# Running Without NPM

## ‚úÖ Good News!

Your project is now configured to run **WITHOUT NPM**! All dependencies are loaded from CDN (Content Delivery Network), so you don't need to install anything.

## How to Run

### Method 1: VS Code Live Server (Recommended)

1. **Install Live Server Extension:**
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Live Server"
   - Install it

2. **Start the Server:**
   - Right-click on `index.html`
   - Select "Open with Live Server"
   - Your browser will open automatically!

### Method 2: Python HTTP Server

If you have Python installed:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project folder
cd "c:\Users\bartm\OneDrive - Microsoft\Documents\Git Repos\Solar"

# Start Python HTTP server
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser to: `http://localhost:8000`

### Method 3: PHP Server (if you have PHP)

```powershell
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open: `http://localhost:8000`

## What Changed?

‚úÖ Converted TypeScript to JavaScript (no compilation needed)
‚úÖ All libraries loaded from CDN (Three.js comes from jsdelivr.net)
‚úÖ Simplified module structure (all in one main.js file)
‚úÖ Import maps handle module resolution
‚úÖ Works in any modern browser with a local server

## Current Features

‚úÖ **Solar System Module** - Sun, Earth, and starfield
‚úÖ **Quantum Module** - Particle and wave visualization  
‚úÖ **VR/AR Support** - WebXR ready
‚úÖ **Interactive Controls** - Speed, brightness, camera
‚úÖ **Object Selection** - Click objects to learn more
‚úÖ **Beautiful UI** - Responsive design with glass-morphism

## Important Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **You MUST use a local server** - Double-clicking `index.html` won't work because:
- Modern browsers block ES6 module imports from `file://` protocol
- Three.js uses ES6 modules which require HTTP(S)

## Troubleshooting

### If Nothing Shows Up:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Make sure you're using a local server (not file://)
3. Check that CSS files exist in `/src/styles/`

### If VR/AR Buttons Don't Appear:
- They only show when WebXR is available
- Try on a device with VR/AR support
- Or they'll show after the scene loads

### If Styles Look Wrong:
- Make sure `src/styles/main.css` and `src/styles/ui.css` exist
- Check browser console for 404 errors

## Next Steps

1. **Start a local server** using one of the methods above
2. **Open your browser** to the local URL
3. **Click the topic buttons** at the top to switch between modules
4. **Click objects** in the 3D scene to learn about them
5. **Adjust controls** at the bottom to customize the experience

## Need More Modules?

Currently implemented:
- ‚úÖ Solar System (basic Sun and Earth)
- ‚úÖ Quantum Physics (particle and wave)
- ‚è≥ Relativity (coming soon)
- ‚è≥ Atomic Structure (coming soon)
- ‚è≥ DNA & Genetics (coming soon)

The other modules can be easily added to `src/main.js` following the same pattern!
