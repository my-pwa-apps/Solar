        descMercury: 'Mercury is the smallest planet and closest to the Sun. Its surface is covered with craters like our Moon. Temperature ranges from -180°C at night to 430°C during the day - the largest temperature swing in the solar system!',
        descVenus: 'Venus is the hottest planet with surface temperature of 465°C due to extreme greenhouse effect. Its atmosphere is 96% CO2 with clouds of sulfuric acid. Venus rotates backwards compared to most planets!',
        descEarth: 'Earth is our home, the only known planet with life! 71% is covered by water, creating the blue color visible from space. The atmosphere protects us from harmful radiation and meteors.',
        descMoon: 'Earth\'s Moon is the fifth largest moon in the solar system. It creates tides, stabilizes Earth\'s tilt, and was formed 4.5 billion years ago when a Mars-sized object hit Earth!',

        descJupiter: 'Jupiter is the largest planet - all other planets could fit inside it! The Great Red Spot is a storm larger than Earth that has raged for at least 400 years. Jupiter has 95 known moons!',
        descSaturn: 'Saturn is famous for its spectacular ring system made of ice and rock particles. It\'s the least dense planet - it would float in water! Saturn has 146 known moons including Titan, which has a thick atmosphere.',
        descUranus: 'Uranus is unique - it rotates on its side! This means its poles take turns facing the Sun during its 84-year orbit. Made of water, methane, and ammonia ices, it appears blue-green due to methane in its atmosphere.',
        descNeptune: 'Neptune is the windiest planet with storms reaching 2,100 km/h! It\'s the farthest planet from the Sun and takes 165 Earth years to complete one orbit. Its blue color comes from methane in the atmosphere.',

        descMercury: 'Mercurius is de kleinste planeet en staat het dichtst bij de Zon. Het oppervlak zit vol kraters, net als onze Maan. De temperatuur schommelt tussen -180°C \'s nachts en 430°C overdag - de grootste temperatuurverschillen in ons zonnestelsel!',
        descVenus: 'Venus is met 465°C de heetste planeet door een extreem broeikaseffect. De atmosfeer bestaat voor 96% uit CO2 en heeft wolken van zwavelzuur. Venus draait bovendien de andere kant op dan de meeste planeten!',
        descEarth: 'De Aarde is ons thuis en de enige bekende planeet met leven! 71% van het oppervlak bestaat uit water, wat onze planeet de blauwe kleur geeft vanuit de ruimte. De atmosfeer beschermt ons tegen gevaarlijke straling en meteorieten.',
        descMoon: 'Onze Maan is de vijfde grootste maan in het zonnestelsel. De Maan zorgt voor eb en vloed, stabiliseert de aardas, en ontstond 4,5 miljard jaar geleden toen een object zo groot als Mars op de Aarde insloeg!',
        descMars: 'Mars, de Rode Planeet, dankt zijn kleur aan ijzeroxide (roest). Mars heeft de hoogste vulkaan (Olympus Mons - 22 km hoog) en de langste kloof (Valles Marineris - 4.000 km lang) in ons zonnestelsel. Bij de polen ligt waterijs!',
        descJupiter: 'Jupiter is veruit de grootste planeet - alle andere planeten passen er samen in! De Grote Rode Vlek is een storm groter dan de Aarde die al minstens 400 jaar raast. Jupiter heeft maar liefst 95 bekende manen!',
        descSaturn: 'Saturnus is beroemd om zijn spectaculaire ringen van ijs- en rotsdeeltjes. Het is de lichtste planeet - lichter dan water, dus Saturnus zou blijven drijven! Saturnus heeft 146 bekende manen, waaronder Titan met zijn dikke atmosfeer.',
        descUranus: 'Uranus is bijzonder - de planeet ligt op zijn zij! Hierdoor wijzen de polen om de beurt naar de Zon tijdens een baan van 84 jaar. Door het methaan in de atmosfeer lijkt Uranus blauwgroen. De planeet bestaat uit water, methaan en ammoniakijs.',
        descNeptune: 'Neptunus is de stormachtigste planeet met windsnelheden tot 2.100 km/u! Het is de verste planeet vanaf de Zon en doet er 165 aardse jaren over om één ronde te maken. De blauwe kleur komt door methaan in de atmosfeer.',
