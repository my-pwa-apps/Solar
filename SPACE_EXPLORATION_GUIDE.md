- They appear as silver probes with antenna dishes

**Apollo 11 site not visible?**
- Press **L** to focus on it
- Look on Earth's Moon surface
- Gold cylindrical marker shows historic location

**Lasers not changing color in VR?**
- Make sure you're pointing directly at spacecraft
- Some are very small - get closer
- Glow auras help identify location
